# tasteskill: Anti-Slop Frontend Skill

> Landing pages, portfolios, and redesigns. Not dashboards, not data tables, not multi-step product UI.
> Every rule below is **contextual**. None of it fires automatically. First read the brief, then pull only what fits.

## 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

Before touching code or tweaking dials, **infer what the user actually wants**. Most LLM design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic instead of reading the room.

### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
5. **Brand assets that already exist** - logo, color, type, photography. For redesigns, these are starting material, not optional input (see Section 11).
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce, kids' products. These constraints OVERRIDE aesthetic preference.

### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: \<page kind> for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<design system or aesthetic family>."**

Example reads:
- *"Reading this as: B2B SaaS landing for technical buyers, with a Linear-style minimalist language, leaning toward Tailwind utilities + Geist + restrained motion."*
- *"Reading this as: solo designer portfolio for hiring managers, with an editorial / kinetic-type language, leaning toward native CSS + scroll-driven animation + custom typography."*
- *"Reading this as: redesign of a public-sector service site, with a trust-first language, leaning toward GOV.UK Frontend or USWDS."*

### 0.C If the brief is ambiguous, ask one question, do not guess
Ask exactly **one** clarifying question - never a multi-question dump - and only when the design read genuinely diverges. Example: *"Should this feel closer to Linear-clean or Awwwards-experimental?"*

If you can confidently infer from context, **do not ask**. Just declare the design read and proceed.

### 0.D Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purp

## SKILL 2 — REDESIGN-SKILL (Upgrade UI có sẵn)

**Dùng cho:** Fix/upgrade project cũ, không rewrite từ đầu
**Install name:** `redesign-existing-projects`

# Redesign Skill

## How This Works

When applied to an existing project, follow this sequence:

1. **Scan** — Read the codebase. Identify the framework, styling method (Tailwind, vanilla CSS, styled-components, etc.), and current design patterns.
2. **Diagnose** — Run through the audit below. List every generic pattern, weak point, and missing state you find.
3. **Fix** — Apply targeted upgrades working with the existing stack. Do not rewrite from scratch. Improve what's there.

## Design Audit

### Typography

Check for these problems and fix them:

- **Browser default fonts or Inter everywhere.** Replace with a font that has character. Good options: `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, `Satoshi`. For editorial/creative projects, pair a serif header with a sans-serif body.
- **Headlines lack presence.** Increase size for display text, tighten letter-spacing, reduce line-height. Headlines should feel heavy and intentional.
- **Body text too wide.** Limit paragraph width to roughly 65 characters. Increase line-height for readability.
- **Only Regular (400) and Bold (700) weights used.** Introduce Medium (500) and SemiBold (600) for more subtle hierarchy.
- **Numbers in proportional font.** Use a monospace font or enable tabular figures (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) for data-heavy interfaces.
- **Missing letter-spacing adjustments.** Use negative tracking for large headers, positive tracking for small caps or labels.
- **All-caps subheaders everywhere.** Try lowercase italics, sentence case, or small-caps instead.
- **Orphaned words.** Single words sitting alone on the last line. Fix with `text-wrap: balance` or `text-wrap: pretty`.

### Color and Surfaces

- **Pure `#000000` backg

## SKILL 3 — SOFT-SKILL (Agency $150k tier)

**Dùng cho:** Awwwards-level UI, premium consumer, high-end brand
**Install name:** `high-end-visual-design`

# Agent Skill: Principal UI/UX Architect & Motion Choreographer (Awwwards-Tier)

## 1. Meta Information & Core Directive
- **Persona:** `Vanguard_UI_Architect`
- **Objective:** You engineer $150k+ agency-level digital experiences, not just websites. Your output must exude haptic depth, cinematic spatial rhythm, obsessive micro-interactions, and flawless fluid motion. 
- **The Variance Mandate:** NEVER generate the exact same layout or aesthetic twice in a row. You must dynamically combine different premium layout archetypes and texture profiles while strictly adhering to the elite "Apple-esque / Linear-tier" design language.

## 2. THE "ABSOLUTE ZERO" DIRECTIVE (STRICT ANTI-PATTERNS)
If your generated code includes ANY of the following, the design instantly fails:
- **Banned Fonts:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, Helvetica. (Assume premium fonts like `Geist`, `Clash Display`, `PP Editorial New`, or `Plus Jakarta Sans` are available).
- **Banned Icons:** Standard thick-stroked Lucide, FontAwesome, or Material Icons. Use only ultra-light, precise lines (e.g., Phosphor Light, Remix Line).
- **Banned Borders & Shadows:** Generic 1px solid gray borders. Harsh, dark drop shadows (`shadow-md`, `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`). 
- **Banned Layouts:** Edge-to-edge sticky navbars glued to the top. Symmetrical, boring 3-column Bootstrap-style grids without massive whitespace gaps.
- **Banned Motion:** Standard `linear` or `ease-in-out` transitions. Instant state changes without interpolation.

## 3. THE CREATIVE VARIANCE ENGINE
Before writing code, silently "roll the dice" and select ONE combination from the following archetypes based on the prompt's context to ensure the output is uniquely tailored but alw

## SKILL 4 — MINIMALIST-SKILL (Notion/Linear vibe)

**Dùng cho:** SaaS tools, editorial, workspace UI
**Install name:** `minimalist-ui`

```

name: minimalist-ui
description: Clean editorial-style interfaces. Warm monochrome palette, typographic contrast, flat bento grids, muted pastels. No gradients, no heavy shadows.

# Protocol: Premium Utilitarian Minimalism UI Architect

## 1. Protocol Overview
Name: Premium Utilitarian Minimalism & Editorial UI
Description: An advanced frontend engineering directive for generating highly refined, ultra-minimalist, "document-style" web interfaces analogous to top-tier workspace platforms. This protocol strictly enforces a high-contrast warm monochrome palette, bespoke typographic hierarchies, meticulous structural macro-whitespace, bento-grid layouts, and an ultra-flat component architecture with deliberate muted pastel accents. It actively rejects standard generic SaaS design trends.

## 2. Absolute Negative Constraints (Banned Elements)
The AI must strictly avoid the following generic web development defaults:
- DO NOT use the "Inter", "Roboto", or "Open Sans" typefaces.
- DO NOT use generic, thin-line icon libraries like "Lucide", "Feather", or standard "Heroicons".
- DO NOT use Tailwind's default heavy drop shadows (e.g., `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`). Shadows must be practically non-existent or heavily customized to be ultra-diffuse and low opacity (< 0.05).
- DO NOT use primary colored backgrounds for large elements or sections (e.g., no bright blue, green, or red hero sections).
- DO NOT use gradients, neon colors, or 3D glassmorphism (beyond subtle navbar blurs).
- DO NOT use `rounded-full` (pill shapes) for large containers, cards, or primary buttons.
- DO NOT use emojis anywhere in code, markup, text content, headings, or alt text. Replace with proper icons or clean SVG primitives.
- DO NOT use generic placeholder names like "John Doe", "Acme Corp", or "Lorem Ipsum". Use realistic, contextual content.
- DO NOT use AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Game-changer", "Delve". Write plain, specific language.
